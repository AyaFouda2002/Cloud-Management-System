# Cloud-Management-System
In this Project, we developed a Cloud Management System using QEMU and Docker. This system allows users to manage virtual machines (VMs) and Docker containers. The project's core objectives include enabling users to create VMs with customizable configurations, generate Dockerfiles for image creation, build Docker images, list existing images and running containers, stop specific containers, search for images locally and on DockerHub, and download/pull Docker images. The program allows user interaction through the GUI. Additionally, robust validation mechanisms ensure correct inputs, providing error alerts for invalid paths and preventing actions until valid inputs are provided.
